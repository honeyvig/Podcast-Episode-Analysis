# Podcast-Episode-Analysis
analyze all 600 of our podcast episodes. Your main task will be to develop AI-driven prompts that will scan through the episodes and extract useful tips. Once AI identifies these tips, it should create email drafts with one tip per email. I have twelve email tips already written that it can use to see how I'm manually doing it. A strong understanding of AI tools and prompt engineering is essential, along with excellent communication skills.
------------
To analyze all 600 podcast episodes, extract useful tips from them, and create email drafts based on those tips, we can leverage AI tools like OpenAI's GPT model for prompt-based extraction and email draft creation. Below is a Python code structure that integrates with GPT to process your podcast transcripts, extract tips, and generate email drafts.
Steps Overview:

    Podcast Transcription: Assuming each podcast episode is transcribed (either manually or through a service like Rev or Whisper).
    Tip Extraction: Use AI to analyze the transcriptions and identify useful tips.
    Email Draft Creation: For each identified tip, generate an email draft using AI-driven prompts.
    Email Draft Storage: Store the emails for review or automated sending.

Python Code Breakdown:

    Install Required Libraries: You'll need openai (for GPT interaction) and some text-processing libraries.

pip install openai
pip install pandas

    Python Code to Analyze Episodes, Extract Tips, and Generate Emails:

import openai
import pandas as pd

# API Key for OpenAI (replace with your own)
openai.api_key = 'your_openai_api_key'

# Function to load podcast transcripts (assuming they are in a CSV file with an 'episode_id' and 'transcript' column)
def load_podcast_transcripts(file_path):
    df = pd.read_csv(file_path)
    return df

# Function to generate a tip extraction prompt
def generate_tip_extraction_prompt(transcript):
    return f"""
    Based on the following podcast transcript, extract one valuable tip or actionable piece of advice:
    {transcript}
    """

# Function to generate an email draft from a tip
def generate_email_draft(tip):
    return f"""
    Subject: Here's a valuable tip to improve your productivity!

    Hi [Recipient],

    I hope you're doing well! Here's a tip that can help you improve your productivity:

    "{tip}"

    Feel free to implement this and let me know how it goes. If you'd like more tips, stay tuned for future emails.

    Best regards,
    [Your Name]

Explanation of the Key Functions:

    load_podcast_transcripts(file_path):
        Loads the podcast transcripts from a CSV file (with columns like episode_id and transcript).
    generate_tip_extraction_prompt(transcript):
        Creates a prompt that will be fed to GPT to extract a useful tip from the provided transcript.
    generate_email_draft(tip):
        Creates an email draft based on the extracted tip. You can modify the email structure as needed.
    extract_tip_from_transcript(transcript):
        Sends the prompt to OpenAI's GPT API, asking it to extract a tip from the transcript. The API's response is processed to extract the text (tip) from the modelâ€™s output.
    process_podcasts_and_generate_emails(df):
        Iterates over all the episodes in your CSV, extracts tips, and generates email drafts. The drafts are stored in a DataFrame and saved to a CSV file for review.

Key Points:

    Tip Extraction: The code uses GPT-3 (via OpenAI's API) to extract one useful tip per podcast episode. The prompt can be adjusted based on your needs.
    Email Drafts: After extracting the tips, an email draft is generated for each episode, which you can then store or send manually.
    Scalability: The script is designed to handle all 600 episodes by processing each in a loop, making it scalable.
    Customization: You can adjust the email format, prompt structure, and other parameters (like the OpenAI model and temperature) to fit your specific use case.

Next Steps:

    Integration: You can integrate this solution into your existing systems, for example, by automating email sending through an SMTP server or using a service like Mailgun.
    Refinement: Fine-tune the AI prompts to better match the types of tips you're looking for (e.g., more specific categories of advice).
    Quality Control: Since AI-generated content may need manual verification, you may want to include a step where you review the extracted tips before they are emailed to your audience.

By using this approach, you can efficiently process your entire podcast library, extract valuable insights, and create consistent email drafts to engage your audience with actionable tips.
